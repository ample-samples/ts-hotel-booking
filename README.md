# Welcome

This is a personal project.
The project will be a hotel guest booking system and is being developed as a way to practice using typescript and gain practice building larger codebases.
## The aim
Currently, it should:
- Recieve input from the user through the commandline.
- Recieve bookings of groups of any (reasonable) number of guests.
- The guests will be booked into rooms of sufficient size and a database should be kept of which rooms are occupied (and how many are staying in each room?).
- The guests will be booked out using their room number and their room will be emptied

The aim and requirements will change as development continues.
